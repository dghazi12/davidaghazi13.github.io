# Unit 13 Node Express Handlebars - Eat-Da-Burger

## Description

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## User Story

    AS A restaurant owner
    I WANT to generate an app that lets users input the names of burgers
    SO THAT I know what they would like to eat

## Criteria

    GIVEN three different burgers

    WHEN the user submits the name of a burger
    THEN the app will display that burger on the left side of the page with a devour button
    WHEN the devour button is clicked
    THEN the burger will move to the right side of the page with a delete button
    WHEN the delete button is clicked
    THEN the burger will be permanently removed from the application
